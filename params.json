This work was part of the project AMPLE – Aspect-Oriented, Model-driven, Product Line  Engineering, coordinated by the university of Lancaster, U.K and several European Union universities and industrial partners. The funding entity was the European Union with 3,7 Millio Keuro. This project finished in 2009\r\n\r\n* MMedusa\r\n[Financed by EAFIT university,  Avansoft S.A and the Colciencias (Department of Administrative Science, Technology and Innovation), Colombia]\r\nResearch project created to define a development framework for the development of Aspect-Oriented Applications. This project finished in 2008.\r\n\r\n* Portable Diagnosis System for Mobile Data Acquisition (Sistema Portátil de Diagnósitico – SPD)\r\n[Financed by Metro de Medellín Ltda., Colciencias (Department of Administrative Science, Technology and Innovation) and EAFIT university, Colombia]\r\nImplementation of the UIC 518 norm of the International Union of Railways in the Metro System of Medellín. This software allows the  analysis and testing of railway vehicles from the point of view of their dynamic behavior, safety, track fatigue and ride quality. This project finished in 2006.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Tools\r\n\r\nI have developed a range of tools to support my research and its industrial application. If you are interested to continue developing one of these tools please send me an email.\r\n\r\n* **VM (Variability Modeling Language and Editor)**. Variability modeling is crucial for the development of highly configurable systems such as video sequences generators and product lines. The variability modeling language provides a light human readable and writable textual notation that is modular, analyzable, aware of attributes, and type safe. The design rational and criteria were given by the industrial needs or our industrial partners in France. The development of this tool is based on JAVA and Xtext (http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext) and it makes interface with the world famous CSP Choco solver (http://choco.emn.fr).\r\n\r\n* **SXFM (Simple XML Feature Model)** Translation to EMF Ecore for SPLOT (Software Product Lines Online Tools) http://www.splot-research.org/. I translated the SPLOT’s SXFM (Simple XML Feature Models) specification to EMF Ecore (http://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/). This tool is composed of Eclipse-based plugins hosted at SPLOT (news). These plugins include an editor for feature models, an Ecore-based metamodel and JAVA code that implements cardinality-based feature models. SPLOT is an open platform based on Open Source software that provides cutting-edge online tools for Software Product Lines. To download it visit : http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca:8088/SPLOT/sxfm.html# (bottom of the page).\r\n\r\n* **VML4RE (Variability Modelling Language for Requirements)**. Managing variability in Requirements Engineering is a key challenge in software product lines (SPL) engineering. An important part of variability management is the ability to explicitly express the relationships between variability models that design variability in the problem space (for example using feature models) and other artifacts of the product line (for example, requirements or design models). Once these relations have been explicitly modeled, they can be used for a number of purposes. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Derivation of product instances based on product configurations specifications,\r\n2. Generation of trace-links between variability and requirements model elements.\r\n\r\nVML4RE is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows to express the relationships between variability elements and requirements model elements, such as use case and activity models. Also, VML4RE  implements special model transformations that are specific to the types of models used to describe an SPL, therefore,  providing a terminology familiar to SPL engineers.\r\n\r\n* ** VCC (Variability Consistency Checker)**. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a successful paradigm to produce a family of products for a specific domain. A challenge in SPLE is to check that different models used in early SPL specification do not contain inconsistent information that may be propagated and generate inconsistent products that do not conform to its requirements. This challenge is difficult to address due to the high number of possible combinations of product features and model fragments specifying those features. VCC (Variability Consistency Checking) offers automatic means to address that challenge. VCC relates information inferred from the relationships between features and from base models related to those features. Validating if all the products in an SPL satisfy user-defined consistency constraints is based on searching for a satisfying assignment of each of the formulas generated by VCC. VCC and its supporting tool were validated on two case studies from different application domains, and the results were encouraging as no significant performance penalties were observed.\r\n\r\n* ** SPD (Portable Diagnosis System for Mobile Data Acquisition)**. I co-leaded and developed the integration process of a specialized software application named SDP.  SPD allowed to implement the UIC 518 norm of the International Union of Railways in the subway of my city: Sistema Metro de Medellín, Colombia. This software allowed to analyze and test railway vehicles from the point of view of their dynamic behavior, safety, track fatigue and ride quality. The implementation was based on LabView (www.ni.com/labview) and MatLab (http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) environments.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Publications\r\n\r\n## International Scientific Journals Articles:\r\n\r\nConsistency Checking in Early SPL Specifications – The VCC Approach\r\n@ Journal of Universal Computer Science -
